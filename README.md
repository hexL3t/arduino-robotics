<h1>Welcome, Junior Engineers!</h1>

<p>This repository holds the files for all the Arduino code you'll learn in the Junior Engineers SumoBots program. Each .ino file here corresponds to a specific presentation taught in the program in the program, providing a clear connection between the concepts you're exploring and the code you'll write.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<ol>
<li><b>Install the Arduino IDE:</b> Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/). This software environment lets you write, upload, and test your Arduino code.</li>
<li><b>Connect Your Arduino Board:</b>Follow the instructions for your specific Arduino board to connect it to your computer using a USB cable.</li>
<li><b>Open the Matching .ino File:</b> Browse through the files in this repository. Each file name corresponds to a specific lesson/presentation in the Aerorobotics program. Open the file that matches the lesson you're currently working on.</li>
<li><b>Upload and Run Your Code:</b> In the Arduino IDE, click the "Upload" button (usually an arrow pointing to the right) to upload the code to your Arduino board. Once uploaded, the code will run on the board, controlling your robot's behavior.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read Comments: Many .ino files will include comments to explain specific sections of code. These comments are your friend! They'll help you understand what the code is doing and how to modify it for your projects.</li>
<li>Experiment: Feel free to tinker with the code and see what happens. Try changing values, adding new lines, or commenting out parts to see how they affect your robot's behavior. This is a great way to learn by doing.</li>
<li>Ask Questions: Don't hesitate to ask your instructor or peers if you get stuck. They're there to help you succeed in your Aerorobotics journey!</li>
</ul>

<h2>File Listing</h2>

<p>This repository contains .ino files corresponding to the Aerorobotics program lessons. The exact files will be added as you progress through the program.</p>
